### How to Run the Frontend

To start the frontend locally:  

1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory in the repository.  
2. Run `npm run web` in your terminal.  
3. Once running, create a room and invite your friends to join! The game supports single-player mode, but itâ€™s much more fun with friends.
